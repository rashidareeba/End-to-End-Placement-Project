# ðŸš€ End-to-End ML Project:
Placement Prediction using Logistic Regression
ðŸ“Š Total Rows: 100 | Columns: CGPA, IQ, Placement (Target)

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Predict whether a student will be placed or not based on their CGPA and IQ score using a classification model.

ðŸ§  Workflow Overview:
ðŸ“¥ Data Collection:
Source: GitHub CSV
Features: cgpa, iq
Target: placement (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

# ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing:
Checked for missing values
Scaled features using StandardScaler()
Transformed features to a numerical array for modeling

# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Used scatterplots and pairplots to visualize feature impact on placement
Found a linear separability between placed and non-placed students

# ðŸ§¾ Feature Selection:
Selected CGPA and IQ as independent variables
placement as dependent variable

# ðŸ”€ Train-Test Split:
Split into training and test sets using train_test_split() (80/20 ratio)

# ðŸ¤– Model Building:
Model: LogisticRegression() from scikit-learn
Fitted on training data
Achieved 100% accuracy on test set (toy dataset)

# ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation:
Metric: accuracy_score()
Confusion matrix analysis

# ðŸ’¾ Model Export:
Saved the model using joblib for future deployment



# ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings:

End-to-end ML workflow
Classification using Logistic Regression
Data visualization and feature scaling
Model export and deployment readiness
